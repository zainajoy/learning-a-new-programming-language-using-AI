🧠 Why Python?

Python was chosen because:

It is beginner friendly

It has simple readable syntax

It is widely used in web development, AI, data science, and automation

It allows you to focus on logic before complexity

📚 End Goal (New MVP)

By the end, the learner will be able to:

Understand variables and data types

Use input and output

Write conditions and loops

Create functions

Use lists and dictionaries

Build a small interactive Python program

🖥 System Requirements

Operating System:

Windows, macOS, or Linux

Tools:

Python 3.x

VS Code (recommended)

⚙️ Installation & Setup
Step 1: Install Python

Go to:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Download and install Python.

IMPORTANT:
✔ Check “Add Python to PATH” during installation.

Step 2: Verify Installation

Open terminal and run:

python --version


You should see something like:

Python 3.12.0


If you see that → Installation successful.

🧩 Minimal Working Examples (Python Fundamentals)

Now instead of CLI MVP and Web MVP, we create:

1️⃣ Basics MVP
2️⃣ Interactive Program MVP

PART 1: Python Basics MVP

Create file:

basics.py

Code:
# Variables
name = "Joy"
age = 20
height = 1.65
is_student = True

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Is Student:")
What You Learn Here

Strings

Integers

Floats

Booleans

Printing output

PART 2: Input & Conditions

Create:

interaction.py

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult,", name)
else:
    print("You are a minor,", name)

What You Learn

input()

Type conversion (int())

If statements

Comparison operators

PART 3: Loops
for i in range(5):
    print("Number:", i)


Learn:

for loops

range()

PART 4: Functions
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Joy"))


Learn:

def

parameters

return

PART 5: Lists & Dictionaries
users = ["Joy", "Mark", "Anne"]

for user in users:
    print(user)

person = {
    "name": "Joy",
    "age": 20
}

print(person["name"])


Learn:

Lists

Dictionaries

Looping through collections

🎓 What This New Project Teaches

Instead of learning CLI tools or web servers…

You now learn:

Variables

Input/output

Type conversion

Conditions

Loops

Functions

Lists

Dictionaries

Basic program structure

This is the REAL foundation of Python.
